The program is a webpage implementing the ACP brevet control times calulator algorithm. The algorithm uses a given distance brevet, as well as a maximum and minimum speed to calculate the the opening time based on maximum speed, and a closing time based on minimum speed. The program is used by inputting a distance and a brevet, and is updated to calculate the opening and closing times by the server.
